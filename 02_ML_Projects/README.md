# Machine Learning Projects

This folder contains **finalized and polished Machine Learning projects** that demonstrate my practical skills in solving real-world problems.

Projects in this directory are carefully selected, cleaned, and structured from my practice work and presented as portfolio-ready case studies.

This section is the **primary showcase** of my Machine Learning and Data Analysis work.

## Purpose of This Folder

Projects included here represent:

* Complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
* Feature Engineering
* Model Building & Evaluation
* Clear problem understanding
* Business insights and conclusions

These projects are transferred here after final refinement from the **03_ML_Practice** folder.
