# End-to-End Machine Learning Projects

This folder contains **production-style End-to-End Machine Learning projects**.

Each project in this directory follows the complete Machine Learning lifecycle, from data ingestion to model evaluation, using a modular and scalable code structure.

These projects demonstrate my ability to build real-world ML solutions similar to industry workflows.
