# Machine Learning Practice

This folder contains my **practice work, experiments, and learning implementations** in Machine Learning and Data Analysis.

The purpose of this section is to document my learning journey and hands-on practice while exploring different concepts, techniques, and datasets.

Projects and notebooks in this directory may not be fully polished. Once refined and structured, selected projects are moved to the **02_ML_Projects** folder as final portfolio projects.

## Purpose of This Folder

This section is used for:

* Concept practice and experimentation
* Trying different datasets from Kaggle or other sources
* Testing preprocessing and feature engineering techniques
* Practicing different machine learning algorithms
* Exploring EDA techniques and visualizations
* Learning new libraries and workflows

---

## Workflow

Learning process followed:

1. Select a dataset
2. Perform initial data exploration
3. Practice data cleaning and preprocessing
4. Experiment with different models
5. Evaluate performance
6. Refine the project

If the project meets portfolio standards:
➡ It is transferred to **02_ML_Projects**

## What This Section Demonstrates

* Continuous learning and consistency
* Hands-on implementation of ML concepts
* Experimentation and problem-solving approach
* Strong practice foundation

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

---

## Note

This folder contains learning and experimental work.
For finalized and portfolio-ready projects, please refer to:

* **02_ML_Projects** → Final ML Projects
* **01_End_to_End** → Production-style ML Projects
