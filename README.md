# Machine Learning Portfolio – Sagar Jain

Welcome to my Machine Learning Portfolio.
This repository contains my end-to-end machine learning projects, practice work, and learning implementations.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate:

* Real-world problem solving using Machine Learning
* End-to-End project development
* Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, and Model Building
* Continuous learning and experimentation

I am currently preparing for roles in:
**Data Analyst | Machine Learning | Data Science**
